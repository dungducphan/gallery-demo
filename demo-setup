# In order to use gallery, you must use the UPS setup command to make the
# appropriate packages active. The appropriate packages include those defined
# by your experiment and which provide the ROOT dictionaries for the data
# products in the file you are going to read.
#
# This example uses the product larsoftobj, which provides the dictionaries for
# all of the LArSoft data products. Setting up larsoftobj also sets up the
# appropriate version of gallery itself.
#
# If you need to install a bundle of product, you can use the pullProducts
# script to do so. An example of how to do that for larsoftobj version 1.08.01
# is shown below. Please use the product name and version appropriate for your
# experiment.
#
#     -- get the pullProducts script, and make it executable
# wget http://scisoft.fnal.gov/scisoft/bundles/tools/pullProducts
# chmod +x pullProducts
#     -- use pullProducts to install larsoftobj (and all of its dependencies)
#     -- under $HOME/products
#     -- Note that <platform> should be one of u14, u16, d14, d15, d16, slf6, slf7
# An example use would be:
# ./pullProducts $HOME/products slf7 dunetpc-v06_33_00 e14 prof

# Adjust the next line, if necessary, to reflect the location into
# which you have installed the products.
PRODUCTS_DIRECTORY="${HOME}/products"
if [ ! -f "${PRODUCTS_DIRECTORY}/setup" ]
then
  echo "You do not have the UPS products installed under ${PRODUCTS_DIRECTORY}"
  echo "Please edit this script to reflect the location of your UPS products."
  return 1
else
  source "${PRODUCTS_DIRECTORY}/setup"

# The following setup assumes you want the specified version of the dunetpc
# software.  You should replace it with whatever product and version is
# appropriate for your experiment. If your experiment has a setup script that
# you have used above, you probably don't need to do this at all. If your
# experiment setup already sets up gallery, you don't need to do (and should not
# do) the gallery setup again. Please note the use of the -B option, and the '+'
# modifiers in the arguments of the -q option. These are used to assure we can
# diagnose an inconsistency between what products you might already have setup,
# the experiment environment you setup, and the qualified version of gallery you
# setup. Forming the regulary habit of using these options is recommended
# practice, because it is best to diagnose incompatibilities before they cause
# compilation failures, linkining failures, or runtime failures.
